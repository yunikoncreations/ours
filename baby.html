        <h2>To our little one,</h2>
        
        <p>Right now, you are a dream we are both having at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>We haven't held you yet, but we are already organizing our lives around your heartbeat. Your father built this little corner of the world just to make sure your mother is cared for, that her thoughts are kept safe, and that we never miss a moment of your beginning.</p>
        
        <p>You are already so loved. Not just for who you will be, but for the way you have already brought us closer together.</p>
        
        <p>We are waiting for you.</p>
